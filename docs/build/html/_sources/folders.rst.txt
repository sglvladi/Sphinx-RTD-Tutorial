Folder structure
================
Let’s start by showcasing the folder structure that we should aim for. Here is the folder structure of an example project, named ``simpleble`` (See `GitHub <https://github.com/sglvladi/simpleble>`_ repo and `ReadTheDocs <http://simpleble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ documentation), which is also the package which we will base our tutorial on:

| simpleble-master
| ├── docs
| │   ├── build
| │   ├── make.bat
| │   ├── Makefile
| │   └── source
| ├── LICENSE
| ├── README.md
| ├── requirements.txt
| └── simpleble
|     └── simpleble.py
| 
| 

In the folder structure above:

- ``simpleble-master`` is the folder we get when we issue a ``git pull/clone`` command
- ``simpleble-master/docs`` is the directory where our Sphinx documentation will reside
- ``simpleble-master/docs/build`` and ``simpleble-master/docs/source`` being the Sphinx build and source directories respectively. These folders are autogenerated for us by Sphinx.
- ``simpleble-master/simpleble`` is the actual Python package directory, where our Python source files reside.

An important note here is that the folder ``simpleble-master`` is what we will refer to as our `Repository root`, while the folder ``simpleble-master/docs`` will be our `Sphinx root` or, equivalently, our `Documentation root`. Similarly, ``simpleble-master/docs/source`` will be our `Sphinx source root` and ``simpleble-master/docs/build`` is our `Sphinx build root`.
