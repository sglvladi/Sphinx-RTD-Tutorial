Writing docstrings
==================

There are several different docstring formats which one can use in order to enable Sphinx's ``autodoc`` extension to automatically generate documentation. For this tutorial we will use the ``Sphinx`` format, since, as the name suggests, it is the standard format used with Sphinx. Other formats include ``Google`` (see `here <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_) and ``NumPy`` (see `here <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy>`_), but they require the use of Sphinx's ``napoleon`` extension, which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The Sphinx docstring format
***************************

In general, a typical ``Sphinx`` docstring has the following format:

.. code-block:: python

    """[Summary]

    :param [ParamName]: [ParamDescription], defaults to [DefaultParamVal]
    :type [ParamName]: [ParamType](, optional)
    ...
    :raises [ErrorType]: [ErrorDescription]
    ...
    :return: [ReturnDescription]
    :rtype: [ReturnType]
    """

A pair of ``:param:`` and ``:type:`` directive options must be used for each parameter we wish to document. The ``:raises:`` option is used to describe any errors that are raised by the code, while the ``:return:`` and ``:rtype:`` options are used to describe any values returned by our code. A more thorough explanation of the ``Sphinx`` docstring format can be found `here <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/docstring_python.html>`_. 

Note that the ``...`` notation has been used above to indicate repetition and should not be used when generating actual docstrings, as can be seen by the example presented below.


An example class with docstrings
******************************** 

Let's have a look at a typical class documentation. In this example we show the docstrings written for the ``SimpleBleDevice`` class, which is defined within our ``simpleble`` module:

.. code-block:: python

    class SimpleBleDevice(object):
        """This is a conceptual class representation of a simple BLE device
        (GATT Server). It is essentially an extended combination of the
        :class:`bluepy.btle.Peripheral` and :class:`bluepy.btle.ScanEntry` classes

        :param client: A handle to the :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient` client
            object that detected the device
        :type client: class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient`

        :type addr: str, optional
        :param addrType: Device address type - one of ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC or
            ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM, defaults to ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC
        :type addrType: str, optional

        :type iface: int, optional

            AD type code, human-readable description and value for all available

            broadcast from the device. This is an integer value measured in dB,
            where 0 dB is the maximum (theoretical) signal strength, and more
            negative numbers indicate a weaker signal, defaults to 0
        :type rssi: int, optional
        :param connectable: `True` if the device supports connections, and `False`
            otherwise (typically used for advertising ‘beacons’).,
            defaults to `False`
        :type connectable: bool, optional
        :param updateCount: Integer count of the number of advertising packets

Docstrings in VS code
*********************

If you are using VS code, the `Python Docstring <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring>`_ extension can be used to auto-generate a docstring snippet once a function/class has been written. If you want the extension to generate docstrings in ``Sphinx`` format, you must set the ``"autoDocstring.docstringFormat": "sphinx"`` setting, under File > Preferences > Settings. 

Note that it is best to write the docstrings once you have fully defined the function/class, as then the extension will generate the full docstring. If you make any changes to the code once a docstring is generated, you will have to manually go and update the affected docstrings.
