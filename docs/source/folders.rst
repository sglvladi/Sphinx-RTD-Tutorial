Folder structure
================
Here is the folder structure of an example project built with RTD, named ``simpleble`` (See `GitHub <https://github.com/sglvladi/simpleble>`_ repo and `ReadTheDocs <http://simpleble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ documentation), which is also the package which we will base our tutorial on:

| simpleble-master/
| ├── docs/
| │   ├── build/
| │   ├── source/
| │   ├── Makefile
| │   └── make.bat
| ├── simpleble/
| │   └── simpleble.py
| ├── LICENSE
| ├── README.md
| └── requirements.txt
| 
| 

In the folder structure above:

- ``simpleble-master`` is the repository root dir we get after a ``git pull/clone`` command
- ``simpleble-master/docs`` is where our Sphinx documentation will reside
- ``simpleble-master/docs/build`` and ``simpleble-master/docs/source`` are documentation build and source directories respectively. These folders are autogenerated by Sphinx.
- ``simpleble-master/simpleble`` is the directory with Python source files.

Note that we refer to ``simpleble-master`` as `Repository root`, and the folder ``simpleble-master/docs`` is our `Sphinx root` or, equivalently, our `Documentation root`. Similarly, ``simpleble-master/docs/source`` is our `Sphinx source root` and ``simpleble-master/docs/build`` is `Sphinx build root`.
